    <h3>Welcome to Un-Natural Disasters!</h3>
    <p>
      We’re a group of students from MIT and Harvard trying to make the world a better (and more
      fun!) place.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ve all heard about it – glaciers are melting, oceans are rising, fires are raging, animals
      are dying, and the weather has gone on strike. <b>Climate change.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we continue with this trend, the one and only place we call home, Earth, will deteriotate
      long before we know it. Bad stuff. So, how do we plan on tackling an issue as big as climate
      change? A game. Yes, you heard us right. We believe a game is the perfect way to raise
      awareness and provide an engaging way for students to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how is a game supposed to fix climate change? ...you might ask. In short, it’s not. But
      what it can do is help us better understand how the mechanisms of climate change affect our
      actions, and how we can step up to start making a difference. And with your actions comes
      change, and with change, we just might end up making the world a better place.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      Every person’s actions matter, so what are you waiting for? Hop over to the{" "}
      <u>How to play tab</u> to get started!
