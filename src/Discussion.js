    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      After playing a game or two, reflect on your experience and try answering these questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>What do chaos and order cards represent in relation to the environment?</li>
      <li>Who is impacted by climate change? To what degree?</li>
      <li>How does climate change affect us and the world around us?</li>
      <li>What caused more natural disasters to be introduced into the environment?</li>
      <li>What might our futures look like if we do not change our current actions?</li>
      <li>What concrete steps can you take to mitigate the effects of climate change?</li>
      <li>
        As seen throughout the game, there are many actions you take on a daily basis that have a
        small but real impact on the world around us. What actions do you currently do and what
        areas can you improve on?
      </li>
      <li>
        Take a moment to reflect on the past game, what style of gameplay did you embrace and what
        end state did you ultimately reach: 1) collaboratively ; 2) competitively; 3) mix of both?
      </li>
      <li>
        Imagine a small climate change oriented project that you could take on - what steps could
        you take to implement it in your class/school?
      </li>
    </ol>
