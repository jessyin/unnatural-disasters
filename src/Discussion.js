      <p>
        After playing a game or two, reflect on your experience and try answering these questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>What do chaos and order cards represent in relation to the environment?</li>
        <li>Who is impacted by climate change? To what degree?</li>
        <li>How does climate change affect us and the world around us?</li>
        <li>What caused more natural disasters to be introduced into the environment?</li>
        <li>What might our futures look like if we do not change our current actions?</li>
        <li>What concrete steps can you take to mitigate the effects of climate change?</li>
        <li>
          As seen throughout the game, there are many actions you take on a daily basis that have a
          small but real impact on the world around us. What actions do you currently do and what
          areas can you improve on?
        </li>
        <li>
          Take a moment to reflect on the past game, what style of gameplay did you embrace and what
          end state did you ultimately reach: 1) collaboratively 2) competitively 3) mix of both? How
          would you play the game differently to acheive the other end state?
        </li>
        <li>
          Imagine a small climate change oriented project that you could take on - what steps could
          you take to implement it in your class/school?
        </li>
      </ol>
